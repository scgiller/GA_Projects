#Data Science Immersive

Project 4 involved salaries for Data Science jobs. I used BeautifulSoup to scrape
salary information from Indeed.com, and then used logistic regression to predict
whether a job would have a salary above or below the median of my sample.

These projects were done as part of General Assembly's Data Science Immersive
course. Blog posts that summarize each project can be found here:
