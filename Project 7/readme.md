Project 7 involved Federal Aviation Administration delay data. Using data on types
of airport delays at every US airport, I used Principal Component Analysis and
k-means clustering to group airports. I then used a decision tree model on the raw
data to determine what features were most important in determining cluster.

These projects were done as part of General Assembly's Data Science Immersive
course. Blog posts that summarize each project can be found here:
