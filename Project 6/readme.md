![]Data Science Immersive

Project 6 involved IMDb ratings pulled using both BeautifulSoup web scraping and the
use of an API. Using multiple types of decision tree models, I attempted to predict
whether a movie would be a Top 250 movie or a Worst 100 movie.

These projects were done as part of General Assembly's Data Science Immersive
course. Blog posts that summarize each project can be found here:
