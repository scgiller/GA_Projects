#Data Science Immersive

Project 5 involved the survival rate of Titanic passengers. After using logistic
regression to predict whether a passenger survived the crash, I improved the model
using a kNN model with GridSearchCV.

These projects were done as part of General Assembly's Data Science Immersive
course. Blog posts that summarize each project can be found here:
